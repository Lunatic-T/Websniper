i wont be updating this anymore unless something is needed 


## Usage:   
Get [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) Extension on your browser then click the extension and make a new script

(if it says enable dev mode in extensions inside the tampermonkey ui, do it.)

Delete everything, Then Paste the Userscript.js text in it, then hit CTRL + S to save and move over to the [Sol's rng Biomes channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186570213077041233/1282542323590496277) on the discord website.

Then make sure the script is running. Once it is running, you can keep the window open while doing whatever you want 


## Sniping:

You can either minimize the discord tab or just keep it in the background and it will snipe for you. 

Don't play Sol's RNG while sniping, it will delay the joining by 1-5 seconds because it unloads the game first before joining.
