# Userscript glitch sniper 
Hi, looks like you found my glitch sniper, leave a star if i got you into Glitch Biome!

## Usage:   
Get [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) Extension on your browser then click the extension and make a new script

Delete everything, Then Paste the Userscript.js, then CTRL + S To Save and move over to the [Sol's rng Biomes channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186570213077041233/1282542323590496277) 
Then make sure the script is running. Once it is running, you can keep the window open while doing whatever you want 

### this needs to be done on the website version of discord, so make sure to log in 

## Efficiency:
If Bloxstrap is giving you a headache, download roblox from microsoft store, and when you're done, Navigate to settings > Apps > Default Apps > Search Roblox > Change it to "Roblox"

and when thats done, play sols rng on the microsoft roblox whenever you're sniping. if you dont open microsoft roblox while sniping it will take 5 more seconds to join, so make sure to keep it open.
