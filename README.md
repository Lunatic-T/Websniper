i wont be updating this anymore unless something is needed 
## Usage:   
Get [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) Extension on your browser then click the extension and make a new script (if it says enable dev mode in extensions inside the tampermonkey ui, do it.)

Delete everything, Then Paste the Userscript.js text in it, then hit CTRL + S to save and move over to the [Sol's rng Biomes channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186570213077041233/1282542323590496277) 

Then make sure the script is running. Once it is running, you can keep the window open while doing whatever you want 

### this needs to be done on the website version of discord, so make sure to log in 

~~For Joining Fast you MUST download roblox from microsoft store, and when you're done, Navigate to settings > Apps > Default Apps > Search Roblox > Change it to "Roblox" (for windows 10 dm .lunary. on discord bcs its complicated)~~

Roblox Discontinued Roblox UWP. The information above is no longer accurate.

and when thats done, u can either minimize the discord tab or just keep it in the background and it will still snipe for you

dont play sol's rng while sniping, it will delay the joining by 1-5 seconds because it unloads the game first before joining.
