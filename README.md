i wont be updating this anymore unless something is needed
## Usage:   
Get [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) Extension on your browser then click the extension and make a new script

Delete everything, Then Paste the Userscript.js, then CTRL + S To Save and move over to the [Sol's rng Biomes channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186570213077041233/1282542323590496277) 

Then make sure the script is running. Once it is running, you can keep the window open while doing whatever you want 

### this needs to be done on the website version of discord, so make sure to log in 

For Joining Fast you MUST download roblox from microsoft store, and when you're done, Navigate to settings > Apps > Default Apps > Search Roblox > Change it to "Roblox" (for windows 10 dm .lunary.)

and when thats done, stay in the home page when you start sniping. if you dont open microsoft roblox while sniping it will take 5 more seconds to join, so make sure to keep it open.

dont play sol's rng on the microsoft ver of roblox because it will delay the join for 1-2s

# SAFETY

~~In order to stay safe, i released a seperate version of this that includes gameid detection.~~
scrapped, now its in python instead of being the same.
you can find it ~~[here](https://github.com/Lunatic-T/PySniper)~~ lowkey privated for being too good rn ill release it when nexus releases prolly
